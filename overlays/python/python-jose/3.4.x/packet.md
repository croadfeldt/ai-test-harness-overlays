# Review packet: python-jose 3.3.0 -> 3.4.0

**In plain terms.** This change updates python-jose from 3.3.0 to 3.4.0, which closes 3 known vulnerabilities. The harness proved 2 of the 3 with a test that fails on the vulnerable version and passes on the fixed one; the other 1 is unproven and marked so. Accept the 7 candidate tests if they look right, act on the findings below, and send the draft VEX statements to Product Security.

Run `76a3fa863e76`. Generated 2026-09-13T13:33:56+00:00. This packet proposes; a reviewer decides. Nothing here has been merged.

## What changed
python-jose at depth 1, change `bumped`, reachable from first-party code: **true**
(8 production references). Risk score 51, budget full.
API diff: +3 / -0 / ~0, 0 breaking.
Advisories: 0 open at head, 5 on the replaced version.

## What was tested
10 generated tests ran in the sealed sandbox on head, again for flakes, and on the base version. 9 pass on head, 0 flaky,
3 fix-pinning confirmed, 573 lines of the package covered. Model: `qwen38-27b`.
Mutation: score 0.25 (3 of 12 sampled mutants killed, 139 sites on executed lines, seed 512944556). Tests that killed nothing: ['test_ghsa_6c5p_j8vq_pqhj_fix_pinning', 'test_ghsa_cjwg_qfpm_7377_exposure', 'test_ghsa_cjwg_qfpm_7377_fix_pinning', 'test_pysec_2025_185_exposure', 'test_pysec_2025_185_fix_pinning']. Target in the blueprint: 0.6.

## Findings
- **defect** (0.4): python-jose: a code path raised the same internal error on both versions during CVE test generation (CVE-2024-33663); NOT corroborated by stage 4 verdicts. Route: escalate: below confidence threshold. Evidence: `generate/python-jose/manifest.agent.json`

## Draft VEX statements (for Product Security)
| vulnerability | status | basis |
|---|---|---|
| CVE-2024-33663 | fixed | fix-pinning test(s) ['test_ghsa_6c5p_j8vq_pqhj_fix_pinning'] fail on pkg:pypi/python-jose@3.3.0 and pass on pk |
| CVE-2024-33664 | fixed | fix-pinning test(s) ['test_ghsa_cjwg_qfpm_7377_fix_pinning', 'test_ghsa_cjwg_qfpm_7377_exposure'] fail on pkg: |
| CVE-2024-29370 | under_investigation | bump to a fixed version per advisory metadata; no confirmed fix-pinning test yet |

## Upgrade path
Not applicable: the change brought the fixed version, or no advisory is open at head.

## Recommended action
**Advisory.** Accept the listed candidate tests into the overlay; act on the findings by routing; confirm the VEX drafts with Product Security.

## Promotions and retirements
None proposed: promotion needs a survived bump or a caught regression (section 8.3); the relevance engine is not in this slice.
